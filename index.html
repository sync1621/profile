            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I was born in Manila Hospital in January 16 2008. My mother's name is Jayleen Ambros she graduated in FEU and my father's name is Michael Ambros and he Graduated in UCC. 
                I grew up with my grandmother and grandfather since my mom and dad always left me with them because of work, and because of that i used to live my everyday life without them that's why as i get older i have realized that i spent most of my life with my grandfather, grandmother, and friends. 
                Getting support from my family is really hard since they are more focused on work but that didn't stop me for reaching my goals as a kid. As a kid who loves basketball, i dreamed about getting into varsity in my elementary school which is the Kaunlaran Elementary School, so i tried out and got accepted. We bring glory in our school because we are able to past 4 levels( district meet, area meet, division, and area meet) and reach NCR but pandemic happens so we didn't get the chance to play for my city Caloocan.
                 Times past, i graduated elementary in 2020. My pandemic life is not that great since problems came to us but that phase of my life is really memorable since i got a lot of lessons there and that's where i become more matured as time past. That's also where i become a part of a pro team in codm, earned money, got a lot of friends, etc. Fast forward last year which is the year i graduated junior high school and in present where i am starting my senior high that i hope it will become great. 
                I guess the things that makes me unique the most is that i accomplished those achievements without my parents guide, that makes me independent as early as a kid.

            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I am interested in sports like Basketball, Volleyball, Sepak, and online games such as Codm, Pubg, and Ml. 
                I am also interested in programming that's why i chose ict as my strand because i really wanna develop a website or an application in the future. I really like to hangout to with my friends when i am free because i liked to travel.

            <h1>Dynamic and Dashboard</h1>
            <br>
            I think the type of data that i will put in my dashboard is my biography, interests, achievement, and my goals using html and css.
             I will use the elements like tables, image, hyperlink, paragraph, headings and some css elements like background color, padding, margin, height, width for my table, etc.

             <h1>Conclusion</h1>
             <br>
             <p>In summary, my life so far has been a mix of personal challenges, achievements, and interests. Growing up with my grandparents in Caloocan City, I quickly learned to be independent and strong, which helped me in basketball and online gaming. Even though the pandemic and lack of parental guidance were tough, I still succeeded in school, sports, and gaming.



                As I start senior high school, I’m excited to keep following my interests in sports, programming, and web design. My goal is to use my skills to create new applications and make a difference in my fields. The dashboard I’m working on will show my story, including my background, interests, achievements, and goals.</p>
